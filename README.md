# Open Hydrant Mapper
A simple, responsive, open source web application for adding and updating fire hydrant data in [OpenStreetMap](openstreetmap.org), the free and editable map of the world. You can use it to add and update fire hydrant data in your area, making an open source and open data map of the world better for everyone.

## Key Features:

While there are plenty of excellent full-featured [OSM editors](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editing) for web and mobile, OHM provides an extremely simple and (hopefully) intuitive interface specifically designed for quickly capturing fire hydrants from your mobile device.

* Open source, can easily be forked and customized to collect different node features.

* Completely client-side implementation utilizing [osm-auth](https://github.com/osmlab/osm-auth) means it can be hosted on [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/).

* Mobile optimized: uses device GPS for higher accuracy location recording, mobile-web-app-capable for adding shortcut icon to homescreen and native-like fullscreen experience.

* Uses HTML 5 [datalist elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) to display standard key values, while also allowing for custom value input.

## Built on the following open source components:

* [uikit](http://getuikit.com/): A lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces.

* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/): An Open-Source JavaScript Library for Mobile-Friendly Interactive Maps.

* [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/): The free and editable map of the world, OpenStreetMap powers map data on hundreds of web sites, mobile apps, and hardware devices
